# Multi Step Form - Vanilla CSS & JavaScript

![Design preview for the Multi-step form coding challenge](preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a front end mentor challenge to build a mutli step form using Vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 

This project contains:

- CSS Nesting
- Media Queries
- Animation
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Pseudo Classes/Elements
- Form Validation
- DOM Manipulation

I think this project contains **90%** of JavaScript & CSS you might use in any of your projects except *fetch* and *Async* in JavaScript.

It was a fun and hard project at the same time but it actually sharpen my Front End Skills and now I can say that I could build websites using CSS & JavaScript effieceny.
